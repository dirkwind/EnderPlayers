# EnderPlayers Minecraft Plugin

This is a plugin inspired by [Ranboo's](https://twitter.com/Ranboosaysstuff) character from the DreamSMP. He has the
unique ability to pick up block's similar to an Enderman. Download will likely be moved to the [SpigotMC website](spigotmc.org)
once the plugin is completely finished. This is my first somewhat legitimate plugin and github repository 
so all help/criticism is welcome and appreciated!
